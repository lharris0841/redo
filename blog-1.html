	  <h1>About George Washington&nbsp;</h1>
	  <p> <a href="../rename.jpg"><img src="../rename.jpg" width="250" height="379" alt=""/></a><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">George Washington was born February 22, 1732.</span> He was elected as the first president by the Electoral College unanimously in 1789. Washington is commonly called the "Father of his country" since he played a major role in fighting for independence and helped form the government we now have. Many of his leadership practices became the template for the way politics have proceeded following his terms. For example his use of a group of counselors known as a "cabinet" is still in practice today. He only served for two terms and then stepped down which became, for the most part, the accepted norm for future presidents.</p>
      <p> George Washington is associated with some folklore tales such as being widely known for admitting to his father that he chopped down a cherry tree proclaiming that he could not tell a lie. He was credited for skipping a coin all the way across the Potomac river. While the cherry tree and coin skipping stories are most likely not true President George Washington accomplished many great things that are astounding and true pieces of our history. </p>

	  <h1>More About George...</h1>
	  <p> <img src="../george.jpg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">George Washington was a colonist, and like many colonists he disapproved of the stamp act that was imposed on the colonies by British law.</span> Also like many of his fellow colonists his opposition to the stamp act alone was not enough to go to war against the British empire. It was not until the Townshend act was declared and implemented that he began to take a leading role in opposing the British forces. Washington regarded the passage of what they called the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges". (Randall p 262)</p>

	  <p> <img src="../boat.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="170" class="floatLeft"/><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">As one of the founding fathers and first elected presidents of the United States, George Washington may be one of the most recognized figures in American history.</span> George Washington was voted into office unanimously in 1788 and again in 1792; during his two terms he successfully brought a new nation together through the creation of a strong and balanced government. He oversaw the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, and during his presidency he established many of the presidential policies still in place today, including the oath of office, presidential salary, and two-term presidential candidacy limits.</p>
